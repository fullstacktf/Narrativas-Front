# Narrativas proyect: Front-end

## Building the project

This project can be built in two different ways.

* **Locally** (node v12 and npm needed)

```bash
  npm install
  npm run serve
```

The front-end app wil be running at http://localhost:8080.

* **Using docker**

```bash
  make build
```

The front-end app wil be running at http://localhost.

This app will not work properly if it is not running along side the backend.
